# PCB Designs

This repository contains various PCB design files for electronic circuits and modules.  
The files are created using PCB design software and include schematics and board layouts.

## 📁 Contents

The repository includes designs for:
- **Astable Multivibrator / Flip-Flop**
- **BMS Board**
- **Current and Voltage Sensor**
- **LDR Sensor**
- **One Channel Relay**
- **Rain Detector**
- **Temperature Sensor**
- **Temperature with Relay Module**
- **Three Channel Relay Module**
- **Two Channel Relay Module**
- **Voltage Divider**
- **Voltage Regulator**
- **ATmega328P with Temperature Sensor**
…and potentially more PCB modules.

> Some board files are in `.dip` and `.dch` formats (possibly from DipTrace or similar tools).

## 🛠️ How to Open / Edit

To view the PCB schematics and layouts:
1. Use PCB design software such as **DipTrace** (or the appropriate tool for `.dip`/`.dch` files).
2. Open the file in the PCB editor to inspect or modify.
3. Export Gerber/production files if you want to fabricate the boards.

## ❓ Notes

- There’s currently no description or documentation for each design — consider adding notes, images, and pin descriptions in future commits.
- You can add *Gerber outputs*, *schematic previews*, or *board photos* for better clarity.
